# current is the current number that gets appended, past is a variable to store the previous number 
# so that you can add it to current. next_n is the number that you use to store the next current so 
# are still able to update current and past.

# while our current number is less than 4,000,000 we append current, defime our next current as itself 
+ prev and then prev as current then you update current to next_n
